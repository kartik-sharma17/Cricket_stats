                    MS Dhoni, fondly known as MSD, is a cricket legend from India.
                    Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, he captained the Indian cricket team and led them to several
                    victories,
                    including the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Known for his calm demeanor and explosive batting,
                    Dhoni popularized the "helicopter shot." He retired from international cricket in August 2020,
                    ending a glorious career that saw him receive accolades like the Padma Bhushan.
                    Off the field, he's involved in business and charity. Dhoni's impact on Indian cricket is profound,
                    making him a revered figure in the sport's history.
